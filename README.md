## Instructions

Create a branch for yourself:

`git checkout -b <my_branch_name>`

*This command will check out a branch. By passing '-b' you tell git that you want to first create a new branch with the name you specify, and then check it out.*

---

For each chapter, create a directory. Easiest way to do so is to run:

`mkdir ch1`

*The command mkdir is short for "make directory" and will create a directory with the name you specify.*

For each exercise, create a file with the name of the exercise. You can do this by saving a file from the IDE, or by running (ex):

`touch 2-1.py`

*The command touch creates a file with the name you specify, or updates the "last modified" date on a file if it already exists.  New files will be empty, existing files will not have their content modified.*

---

Git allows you to create snapshots of your work, called commits. Commits will only include the files you want to be included, so you could make changes to multiple files but only snapshot a subset of the files changed if you wanted. When to create a commit varies based on the project and person, but think of each commit as being like a save file for a video game: each commit is a place you could go back to later if you needed to, so use them generously.

Each commit should include a message that is descriptive of what you changed since the last commit.
